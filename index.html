			 <p>Yes, I am surrounded by Singaporeans and Malaysians. Yes, I - an Australian - have used ‘lah’ in a sentence everyday this week. What am I becoming? Siao ah!😛 (learning their way of speaking is just damn shiok lah! I’m wanting to advance to meh and lor next.)</p>

			 <p>What I love about Emacs and Lisp for my own computer projects is that it’s a peaceful back water. Sure, it needs a lick of paint but you can still do everything they are doing in the big city and the property developers haven’t found an angle yet.</p>

			 <p>In the midst of lines and crossed purposes, the buildings struggle to remember they are buildings. They dissolve into their parts - windows, eaves, paths - then further - lines, colours, points - then only light.</p>

			 <p>I feel like the only redeeming part of lawn care is being able to use a tool called a “whipper snipper” and yet the world won’t let go of “line trimmer” or “string trimmer”. Yuck.</p>

<p>Look for the best examples of each side of the argument. A bit of googling will show compassion and fact are on the same side.</p>

			 <p>When I left my childhood town, I didn&rsquo;t make a new home. The city I moved to, and the many houses I lived in through the years, held people who became my friends and adopted family, but my connection to the place was like an explorer on an outward mission. The new city was nice, but surely I was bound for somewhere else. If you asked my where &lsquo;my home&rsquo; was, I&rsquo;d have had to think twice or I would name where I grew up.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After a few decades of things that didn&rsquo;t happen, and as the pandemic rolled in, I put that aside. It has been an unexpected relief and a lowering of boundaries. Now saying &lsquo;I am home&rsquo; feels like a blurring of the edges of me. The noises, the strangers, the friends, the streets - ever young and shifting and all cupped in the the ancient hands of the surrounding mountains. All these things feel like a source of comfort and energy as I imagine them.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I might say &lsquo;this is my home&rsquo;, but it feels like I belong to it. I know that the mountains easily cradle the city, so surely they can hold my troubles too.</p>
<p>In the future I might move on, but I won&rsquo;t make the mistake of not making that place home.</p>

			 <p><strong>e-motions</strong>
Are they precisely made and rolling
Down the conveyor belt into me
Are they calculated cause and effect or
Wild shapes spotted in curly clouds
Are they shifting past like symphonies or
Piercing and stuck, tinnitus in silence.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781880448809">The Shattered Goddess</a> by Darrell Schweitzer 📚</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read this book many times. I love Schweitzer&rsquo;s take on dark fantasy. It is grim, but beautiful.</p>

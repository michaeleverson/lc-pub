			 <p>When I was in Siem Reap recently, I had this amazing vegan hamburger and chips. So tasty and so giant haha. Seriously in my top 10 burgers ever. Before I left I thanked the lady who made it, then she said to me ‚ÄúI want to say something to you! Thank you for giving me the opportunity to serve you!‚Äù And then she did the Cambodian style thank you bow üôè. For some reason I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. Maybe it‚Äôs the combination of a slight culture shock moment, the wholesomeness and and the politeness.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23990974/social-media-2023-fediverse-mastodon-threads-activitypub">Nice article from the verge</a> about how the internet still has a chance to not be a complete commercial hellscape. I agree that we need a protocol to unbundle the big platforms into a thousand small ones linked via that protocol. And we have the Fediverse and ActivityPub already. Not perfect, but I‚Äôll take it.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781250847393">The Saint of Bright Doors</a> by Vajra Chandrasekera üìö</p>
<p>A boy gets his shadow cut off by his mother when he very young, which makes him apt to float into the sky and (maybe?) immune to fire. His mother also trains him to assassinate his father, which he is not keen on. He moves away to start a better life into an ancient city with magical doors, but his mother‚Äôs schemes are not so easily cast aside.</p>
<p>The prose often pendulums into a dreamy, magical realism style then back into a more visceral dark fantasy.</p>
<p>Fantastic read. Recommended.</p>

			 <p>When I left my childhood town, I didn&rsquo;t make a new home. The city I moved to, and the many houses I lived in through the years, held people who became my friends and adopted family, but my connection to the place was like an explorer on an outward mission. The new city was nice, but surely I was bound for somewhere else. If you asked my where &lsquo;my home&rsquo; was, I&rsquo;d have had to think twice or I would name where I grew up.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After a few decades of things that didn&rsquo;t happen, and as the pandemic rolled in, I put that aside. It has been an unexpected relief and a lowering of boundaries. Now saying &lsquo;I am home&rsquo; feels like a blurring of the edges of me. The noises, the strangers, the friends, the streets - ever young and shifting and all cupped in the the ancient hands of the surrounding mountains. All these things feel like a source of comfort and energy as I imagine them.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I might say &lsquo;this is my home&rsquo;, but it feels like I belong to it. I know that the mountains easily cradle the city, so surely they can hold my troubles too.</p>
<p>In the future I might move on, but I won&rsquo;t make the mistake of not making that place home.</p>
